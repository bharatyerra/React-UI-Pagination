# React-UI-Pagination

A reusable ui paginate component built with React JS and ES6

The paginate component splits any list into pages, depending upon the page size provided

The component provides buttons to jump to First, Previous, Next and Last pages

User can also jump to any page by typing in page number and pressing enter or clicking Go button

If an invalid page number is entered, the component stays on the same page

The component expects a full list, refreshPage callback and page size

Babel is used to convert ES6/JSX to ES5/js files to cater for browsers like IE9/IE11
